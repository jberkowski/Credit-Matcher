To work properly, it requires .xlsx export file from GetPaid. Output is a table that lists matched amounts for credits and debits.

## Instructions

Instructions are included in main interface.

1. "Below provide path to save archive copy of used data:" - this option allows for central storage of used GetPaid export files. The archive copy is saved in chosen location at the moment when GetPaid export file is selected and imported.
This ensures that saved copy is unchanged by the collector.
